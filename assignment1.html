    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
   
    HTML <i>(Hypertext Markup Language)</i> is used to create document on the <u>World Wide Web.</u> It is simply a collection of certain key words called <b>"Tags"</b> that are helpful in writing the document to be displayed using a browser on the Internet. HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1992.
